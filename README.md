# Mental Health Classification Project

This project uses a dataset from Kaggle to predict whether a person seeks treatment for mental health using various machine learning classification models.

## Dataset

Source: [Kaggle - Mental Health in Tech Survey](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey)

## Objective

To build and evaluate classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM) for predicting mental health treatment status.

## Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall

## File Structure

- `mental_health_classification.ipynb` : Main notebook with all code and output.
- `survey.csv` : Dataset used for model building.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter/Colab
3. Run the cells to see model training and evaluation
